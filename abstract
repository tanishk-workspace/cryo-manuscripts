Cryogenic engines are excellent in providing very high specific impulse at varied design altitudes. Its performance is heavily influenced by effects such as the ‘chill down,’ regen cooling, resonance, and combustion instability. One of the traditional setbacks faced by cryogenic engines is the combustion instability. Unlike solid and hybrid propellant, liquid propellant rocket engines poorly handle the combustion instability causing pressure and propellant flow rate fluctuations (also known as L* oscillations). These complex pressure and mass flow rate spikes change a variety of parameters, such as standoff distance of flame, mixing of propellants, temperature gradient, etc. Also, there's the added problem of multi-phase mixing of propellant (H₂ gas and LOX) in cryogenic engines. The interaction between these phases is much harder to predict due to the complexity involved. This paper intends to explore a possible set of approaches to minimize combustion instability and try to map its ‘efficacy’ in a reduced model approach. These may include shifting the baffle plate in accordance with flame standoff (X*) distance; acoustic liners or resonators to cancel shockwaves; actively changing MR with a change in gimbal angle during trajectory change; active pulse cancellation by inducing a secondary disturbance to cancel out the latter; and plasma propellants. Since H₂O is a highly polar molecule, it is possible to use plasma to change the heat localized in a desired spot, weakening oscillation amplitude. Possibly to use it near nozzles to entirely separate the flow.
