Cryogenic engines are excellent in providing very high specific impulse in a varied design altitudes. It’s performance is heavily influenced effects such as the ‘chill down’, regen cooling, resonance, and combustion instability. One of the traditional setbacks faced by cryogenic engines is the combustion instability. Unlike Solid and hybrid propellant, liquid propellant rocket engines poorly handle the combustion instability causing pressure and propellant flow rate fluctuations (also known as L* oscillations), these complex pressure and mass flow rate spikes, changes a variety of parameters such as standoff distance of flame, mixing of propellants, temperature gradient etc. Also, the added problem of multi-phase mixing of propellant (H2 gas and LOX) in cryogenic engine. The interaction between these phases that are much harder to predict due to complexity involved. This paper intends to explore possible set of approaches to minimize combustion instability and try to map its ‘efficacy’ in a reduced model approach. These may include: Shifting the bafle-plate in accordance with flame stand-off (X*) distance; Acoustic liners or resonators to cancel shockwaves ; Actively changing MR with a change in gimbal angle during trajectory change; Active pulse cancellation by inducing a secondary disturbance to cancel out the later; Plasma-propellants: Since H2O is highly polar molecule it is possible to use plasma to change the heat localize in a desired spot weaking oscillation amplitude. Possibly to use it near nozzles to entirely separate the flow.
