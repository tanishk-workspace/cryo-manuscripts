Cryogenic engines are excellent in providing very high specific impulse across a range of design conditions. However, their performance is significantly affected by factors such as chill-down, regenerative cooling, resonance, and combustion instability. One of the traditional setbacks faced by cryogenic engines is the combustion instability. Unlike solid and hybrid propellant, liquid propellant rocket engines particularly susceptible to combustion instability, causing pressure and propellant flow rate fluctuations (also known as L* oscillations). These complex pressure and mass flow rate spikes can alter a variety/various of parameters, such as standoff distance of flame, mixing of propellants and temperature gradient, etc. Additionally, the problem of multi-phase mixing of propellant (H₂ gas and LOX) exists in cryogenic engines. The interaction between these phases is much harder to predict due to the complexity involved. This paper intends to explore potential approaches to minimize combustion instability and assess their effectiveness using a reduced model approach. These may include adjusting the baffle plate in accordance with flame standoff (X*) distance, using acoustic liners or resonators to dampen the shockwaves; actively modifying MR with change in gimbal angle during trajectory change, introducing a secondary distribution to cancel out oscillations and using plasma with propellants. Since H₂O is a highly polar molecule, plasma to change the heat distribution at a specific location, reducing the oscillation amplitude. Possibly to use it near nozzles to entirely separate the flow.
